Of time in my life is a commuter School the age ranges of people attending the school buried quite widely and I suppose I wouldn't categorize the  Environment as being especially socially conducive so I was quite reserved. I would spend most of my time alone playing video games at home or even if school and in like a library, I would watch movies. You can watch movies in the library free. Would you that often? I felt quite uncomfortable with my own  Popularity I suppose in that in that time. I've felt pretty isolated from other folks and I think  Dad has a lot to do with me being the shyness that I experienced as a high-school student, but Amplified to an even greater degree.   \n",

Could you describe your personality in that situation? One of my friends has a TV show and so we had a party to kick off the pilot. It was like a pilot party and he invited all the people that work on the show that was majority of the people that were there at the party and then a few other people that were hers personal friends. I was one of those personal friends, but some of them also knew people that worked with him. So since everyone already was in the entertainment industry, they all talked to each other and I wasn't in the entertainment industry and I didn't really know what to say. So I just wanted to see busy anyone's the kitchen and made food for everyone and cleaned and just spent the entire time being a busybody.   \n",

       " 680  I've had several situations where I've been in a social setting where I didn't know any of the other people or perhaps. I only knew one person of that person was often seen other people in the area. These are situations in which to a certain extent. I do feel like I have a strong sense of self and I'm able to carry on in that scenario and feel pretty good. Part of the reason that I think I sometimes feel uncomfortable in those situations, says, just typically, I'm in person who really values my impact on others and wants to make sure that other people are comfortable. And so, when I have minimal information about the people around me, it can be a bit harder to make decisions on how to best accommodate or connect with other people. I am interested in connecting with others and so it is something that I push myself to do in those situations. Typically feel I'm pretty competent, but I do experience internally more doubts when I just have last information about the people who are around me. I found that just walking up to people and connecting with them tend to be pretty easy. Once I am able to get over that sort of pump with it.   \n",

One in particular was particularly uncomfortable for me because the other girls that I had met throughout events, that I had been to weren't there. So what I usually do in situations like that is, I tend to turn up the positive aspects of my personality. I connected with girls around me. I asked them questions. I took a vested interest in the things that they had died, and I took over the role of listener. Instead of the role of Chalker. It was, I would say that I put other people at ease. I am very easygoing, and I really do, do my best to learn about other people and kind of Try to make other people feel comfortable, and focus on my discomfort and more on other people's comfort.   \n",

I go to University of Florida and last year. I moved there and moved in the dorms and I didn't know anybody going there from my school or state or anything. I didn't know anybody and I'm in May I live in Maryland. So it's a big, a big move and I was I was pretty scared and anxious about it, going into it and the first couple days I was there. I didn't really meet anyone. So I was like, all this is that I'm not going to meet anyone and it was scary. But then I realize that I just got up, everyone's in that situation. So I started just saying hi to everyone and asking people. If they wanted to do stuff in really quickly. I met a lot of great people. And then looking back at it. I was like, that's  It was unnecessary. We still worried because I am a very social person and I am very good at.  Making new friends and see. I really wasn't anything to worry about and I was in an up being great, and I loved it there. So.   \n",

During a time when I was in a social setting, which I felt uncomfortable situation is not uncommon for me. I did feel that bit aloof from the community up in the crowd on myself that there wasn't really anything to talk about and there wasn't any way to really connect, those out that I was interacting with.  My personality situation, I would say, as I've said already, I was a bit aloof. I was nervous. I was shy and  I guess I could also say that I was a bit upset with myself that I wasn't able to.  Get that level of comfort with the social setting on.   \n",

I believe that everything has a place and should be returned to that place when you're done using it. I worked as a class assistant this past semester for trial advocacy performance section. And in that role, I was responsible for removing all of the crops that would be needed for that night's performances and then returning them after the fact so I kept a very careful record of what I removed and what I needed to return and made sure that I only took what was necessary for each trip. I also kept track of the passwords to get into and out of that Supply Closet and it was a nice exercise in practicing my security when it came to the assets of my organization.   \n",

Already plates. I tend to be organized and also try to stay out of the way, which is difficult.  That works. That was a passage to the office.  so it just takes some effort to make space to  keep things in order.  As well as try not to inconvenience others.  I can't ask for health in that sort of situation.   \n",

       " 3    Remember a time when you finish using equipment at work and you could put everything back in place or not to describe your personality in that situation. Yes at work. I'm bartender. So there is a lot of different equipment that we need some time. I'm all the time. We already have that equipment out. But sometimes there are certain things only need for certain things like a blender or a torch if we're going to torch something for a specific drink a wheels of a brander specifically for coconut and Weaver, and it all  like all the coconuts and it has a logo for the restaurant. We fill the Coconuts with different Liquors and stuff and I am very meticulous. So I have everything organized I get all the Coconuts out and then I take out the brander get that heated while I'm taking out the Coconuts already. I would brand everything and then have it cool cuz it's a very very hot Brandy and then I would put all the Coconuts away. And then while the brander was cool, but then I would be cold then I would go ahead and put the brand or away. So I would get everything done probably very fast in the way that would be cleaning up right after myself. I would clean as I go in that situation any time that I have to use equipment or different specialty equipment at work or in my regular life. I pretty much keep everything clean my own life to   \n",

And so when I use a piece of equipment or things like that at work, I tend to be someone who always puts them the way that they were and sometimes even when I noticed that things are out of place or that there's not enough of something, something's not stocked up. I will take it upon myself to sort that out either finding the resources or getting in touch with whoever is in charge of refilling those resources. Generally, I find that it's important to me, that things are in the correct place and working correctly. I know that this really eases the burden on other people at the clinic who might be looking for materials. And I feel compassionate for those people, particularly because I've experienced. I know others have experienced times when things aren't where they're supposed to be and that causes hardship and confusion, and makes it more difficult to be on time and show up in a way that's present and clear with clients and that is really important to me.   \n",

I tend to be very neat and orderly. I like organization. I like items. Having a designated place to be put back. So typically when it's time to return my supplies to their designated area, I wrap everything up very, very neatly and cleanly, I put everything back where it is supposed to be and that actually makes me feel very calm that I don't have any guesswork to do. I really like structure, I appreciate order and I would say that in that moment. My personality is come reassured and ground. It.   \n",

But I did used to play badminton in high school and after practice, we would always have to put the Mets away.  Show. That was always a big process. It's kind of difficult, a lot of components involved and I am not.  I'm not that great at knowing how to do it or anything. But so I can time it was my turn to put all the nuts away and I had to figure it out cuz I didn't really know how to do it my first time and I just stuck with it. I'm I'm pretty good at looking at things and figuring out how they work.  That's what I did. I felt looked it was logical and I've actually figured out except to work on it for a bit. And now I can do it super quickly. So, you know, just practice is always good.   \n",

I feel that.  I'd say that in my mind running at the time. I woke before I go into any further detail. I did work in a restaurant. So, putting things back into the proper place is vital and I consider myself very clean, very neat, and very organized person. So it's up, hold myself to that standard I guess.  I focused more on my shopping, sponsor ball and  I guess my personality in that would be that I was doing my best to be clean that I was being loyal to what I committed myself to when I sign up for the job.   \n",

I think what that  demonstrates about me and my personality is that I pretty thoughtful maybe typically before I answer or ask question write it down or consider possible responses for hand and  I think that is an important part of my personnel.   \n",

Could you describe your personality in that situation? I work a lot and in a bar setting it's very fast-paced any time that it is a busy day. So any weekend day or for us also Tuesdays because we do Taco Tuesday 7 Mexican restaurant. It's very very busy and sometimes it's just chaos and you don't have time to game plan beforehand because it has just happened. So sometimes I jump in and assume leadership and just start delegating more people need to go whether my managers there are not and he already knows that I do this but he appreciates that I do it because he's already doing something else. And since I keep everything clean, I also make sure that everything else sees in the same. Order and everyone else is doing the same thing keeping in their same order if they use something and they don't put it away than I tell them that they should put it away and make sure that they're keeping up with my standards as well if they're going to work around me.   \n",

       " 680  Personally, in group discussions. I find myself vacillating between listening and leading roles being a good listener. Something that I really pride myself on and is very important to the work that I currently do. And so being able to hear others opinions is helpful for me because it allows me to understand people better. If it allows me to access compassion for them and understanding of their perspective to get a sense of other people's opinions. All of those are very important to me. And there are times when I enjoy a leading role as well. This is particularly when I feel I do have some expertise on the topic or that it's something that others are not taking the lead on and it feels important to keep the conversation going or push it to important topics that have not yet been addressed in that conversation. And so it's important to me really balance those things. I don't typically take Eating rolls. If I feel that that leading role will lead to me, sort of usurping the conversation, directing it for my own interest or anything like that. I find is important to really balance bleeding things and pushing and conversation forward to important areas. While, also being able to step back and really listen to the people who are also taking part in that discussion. I think in a workplace, it's really important that all people are valued. And when I access my empathy, I think about what I've been part of a group discussions, led by other people and just feeling remembering feeling that it was nice to be included. And making sure that everyone's perspective is hard.   \n",

I'm charismatic. I'm a good listener. I am compassionate. I'm strong. I'm organized.  I tend to put the needs of the people that I'm bleeding ahead of my own. I am open to criticism. I actually welcome it. I use it for self-improvement and for bettering the team Dynamic. I pay very close attention to the needs of the people around me and I adjust myself and my behaviors to fit the situation appropriately.   \n",

I felt that I would be the one that typically took all those discussions.  Most people didn't really care and thought I was Dumb and just didn't really want to participate, but I usually be interested in the material and I would want to get a good grade. So I usually ended up taking charge and reading them and got to stepping up since nobody else wanted to. Typically I do tend to assume leadership positions just because I don't like being told what to do. So I often like that's not that it's I would prefer being the one in charge.  Compared to anything else.  And so I would oftentimes take the lead lead the discussion kind of guy that you know, I'm always good at keeping conversations going. So if I thought that we needed more I would just keep prompting and ask you more questions. So eventually get a really good discussion guy.   \n",

So in a listening role, I feel very comfortable. I feel very myself and I'm able to approach the task with great confidence with the leadership role. I'm not the most confident. I'm not the most comfortable in that role on. That doesn't mean I stay away from it though. I do my best and I work as hard as I can.  In that rule, however, as I said being leadership in a leadership role, I'm not too comfortable.  And I feel bad because of my lack of confidence. It affects my  Text My overall performance.   \n",

Could you describe your personality and chelation? Yes. Also having to do with work recently before the shutdown. I do like to take on everything especially if the ship is going down. Then I take everything on and make sure that doesn't go down and keep everything afloat one time after the holidays. It was very very busy New Years was incredibly busy and I had some personal things going on, but you can't not work during the holidays, so I went to work and Then I started breaking down because it became too busy and too much to handle. So I went and talked to my manager and communicated what was happening and I said that I needed to switch out with someone so that I can go do something else that would be productive while they were taking on this and it was very difficult for me to do that because I like to take everything on and I don't like to look like or feel like a failure but I have learned that I can't always take everything on it. I do need to communicate if I want the ship to not go down.   \n",

Attempting a task that I'm not able to figure out on my own. It's remains important to me to still do the job. If it was assigned to me and be the primary and a weed on the task.

       " 682  The situation actually happens to me quite often because I work at a front desk at a hotel.  So a lot of times and often times I'm there by myself, as the only one in those out and I will always have customers coming up to me with situation cuz I am still fairly new. Also. I've only worked there a couple months. So I don't you takes a while to know everything there is to know about procedures and everything at the hotel. So, a lot of times customers or guests will come up in present to me with something and I really am not sure what path to take in resolving that issue.  But I am very thoughtful and intuitive when it comes to those things. I figure out what would probably be the most logical way to respond to this do instead of calling my boss or waiting for the next person to get there and just letting them deal with it. I try to do with it myself to the best of my ability and sometimes it'll be a case where I will have to call my boss, but I won't ever leave it for the next person because I wouldn't want anyone to do that to me and I just don't think that's the right thing to do. So I do will always try my hardest to figure it out, myself and do the right thing. And if not, I will call my boss.  And then we'll resolve it that way.   \n",

I'm very determined. My will? I have a very strong willpower in the sense that, despite whatever odds are against me. I'm able to push past whatever limits tend to want me back when I push myself harder.  To do something. I feel bad. I really become a better person. Then the hard work that I put in makes me stronger and more better or resilient to any future tasks that I'm   \n",

We would have these really big sales that were very close to Holiday time, and it was my first time dealing with that. So obviously,  It was busier than usual because people shop a lot during the time. We're getting to your Christmas presents and stuff like that.  What I did is I kind of just all, like, what was in my control. I kept calm, cool collected mindset and just like walking through stuff in my mind as I was doing it.  I'm just really being mindful of the environment and be mindful of like like employees and customers.   \n",

       " 3    Remember a time when you're invited to an after-work social event and that you decided to join or skip it. Could you describe your personality. Situation? Yes this happens.  Any time that I would be invited I declined it because I do not mix my personal life with my work life. And that is just how I have always been so in turn I actually don't get invited to many things, which is fine with me sometime. I have made friends at work and hang out with people. That's fine. But just because of  Maybe 10 years experience of work and then trying to make friends with everyone that I work with and learning that not everyone is worth it. So I don't push myself to have to make friends at work. Sometimes it just naturally happens. But most of the time I will just declined something else is something that I want to do and then I will invite someone to it but just who I am. I usually like to keep my personal life in my professional life separate, especially because I work in a bar.   \n",

As long as I feel like those will remain intact and the social event is socially appropriate in that, I typically will decide to join it. I do really enjoy connecting with co-workers, particularly at organizations. I really value because I feel like we share a set of values and interests that make it really important and exciting to connect with other people on. And I consider myself to be someone who is social and really value that connection. I think that I can improve the culture in the workplace itself to have deeper connections with the people outside work.   \n",

But also because then it's energy for all of us to be able to work a 12-hour shifts during New Year's Eve.   \n",

Sometimes emotionally, sometimes in a practical sense and sometimes both. And so I think that this contributes to a helpful work culture where everyone can feel supportive.

Then I am compassionate towards that will take my time and, and thoughtful, and loving towards my team. I choose to raise the beer or the last. It's a time where someone doesn't need me to help them. They really just need to process something on their own, just as happy to let them do that on their own as well. But my personality and this particular venue is, very gentle, very soft. I listen.

       " 682  So this often happens on sports teams when we're losing or with a big game and we're not doing well, and I always try to be, I tend to be very positive. I have a very positive outlook. So even if we are losing, there's always the hey, we can, we can still win. And, and I would always tell people that if they were feeling upset about it, or I guess I thought your day today, but, you know, there's a lot, plenty of other games. And you know, what? The end of the day for fun. So as long as you're just make the most out of it and try your hardest and then that's all you can do. And so that's type it. Typically I I don't like seeing people upset or down. I think especially as somebody is supposed to be fun like sports game or anything. So I always try my hardest and try to be that person that they know that I can come to for support and just just for help or anything and  So yeah, I say that I would I would be a good person for that just raising morale and just keeping staying positive is a huge thing for me. I always try and stay positive and I try to reflect that on the others.   \n",

Somebody sad about something it.  It's a response. It's an emotional response and it's important. I feel that raising the spirits of somebody else is.

I'm someone who is, as I mentioned, very meticulous, and also really hard working. And so, if it's something that I'm able to build up to, that's really important to me to feel like I make sure that the opportunity is a good fit and to ensure that I know everything about it to make sure that it it seems like it actually would be a good fit for me and that I would be a good fit for the opportunity itself. I'm so in terms of acting impulsively, that's not something that I tend to do. I think that being level-headed and thoughtful about decisions is very important. And even if I did want something really badly, I think I would really want to make sure I wave any decisions before making them.  \n",

Impulse is not something that I typically do. If it were the required action for something that I really, really wanted then, yes, I would rise to the occasion and go with that. Impulse it would be difficult for me. I am very thought-out. I really do take my time instead of acting on impulse is in general.  Very meticulous. I'm deliberate in my actions. I'm not particularly spontaneous. So it is a little bit difficult for me to act on impulse. But if it were something that I wanted badly enough, it is something that I would rise to the occasion to do.  \n",
       " 682  Neither wasn't a situation where it was an Impulse, but they're obviously were raises that I wanted to get. But for this it's more of a slow process from the beginning. I knew that I would probably eventually want a raise or upgraded position. So, I just from the beginning, you know, it's the process. I would just always work. My hardest show management that I knew what I was doing. I liked what I was doing. I'm a good hard worker. I'm good with being nice to all the gas cuz I work in customer service. Be nice to all of the gas then really just treat them well and do my job correctly. So that  knowing that when the time comes to be considered, they would look at me and think while she's always been good at her job. And and also it's just that's just the right thing to do is always just try your hardest and have a good worth it epic. So I typically always send to do my job to the best of my ability because they benefits everyone. And I think that that's a really good trait to have  \n",

Some of those decisions were a negative amount of money. For example, one time I left a job. I didn't like to take a lower paying job because I felt that the opportunity in that job was worth the lower amount of money. And it did work out eventually I did Increase my pay even higher than before but it did take about three years. So overall I think it was a good decision and I did make some really good professional contacts from that. So I do take risks like that. Where it could end up as a negative overall, but but this one lucky for me was the positive.  I did recently join a new team about a year and four months ago and it was very difficult because we were working remotely. The team had worked in person together prior to covid, so they had seen each other every day. They had built these relationships and then I came in and I didn't know anybody, there was hardly any opportunities to interact in person. And so, when I came in, I was just kind of, like, greasing everybody up. Like, hey, I know, you're so busy, but can you help me with something or can you look at this, like just just acknowledging that they were busy and that they would be doing me a great favor by helping me with learning new things, or Or. And occasionally, I try to make it personal and talk to them about their kids or their white fur, whatever their interests are. Just so we could kind of form that interpersonal relationship.  There have definitely been times where someone has annoyed me. Normally it's a situation where I asked someone to do something or take care of something and they don't do it or I remind them and they still don't do it. Which is so irritating to me because I feel like I'm a person who if you ask me to do something. I'm going to do it and I'll take care of it and you don't have to ask me twice. So for me to have to ask someone multiple times to do their job is super stressful for me but I try to keep it positive like hey as soon as you do this I can stop bugging you about this and we can in my head I'm thinking we can all move on with our lives and hopefully I don't have to talk to you about the situation again, but of course always just try to keep it positive like hey if You do this for me, we can close this project and we can be done and try to spin it in a way that shows the benefit to them.  Occasionally, my workspace does get disorganized. I think that the greatest reason that that occurs is because when I get unhappy especially in a work situation. If I'm bored, I some super unorganized just because I don't see a benefit and being organized if I'm bored. I'm like this won't gain me anything. Thing. But if I'm super busy then I'm like, I got to have everything exactly where I need it and I know where it is so I can access it easily and So yeah, it would say that's the primary reason that I become disorganized as boredom being busy, really, keeps me on my toes and requires a lot of organization when I'm just overloaded with things to do.  \n",
       " 1    Well situations, where I'm a professional decisions and can affect my status or how much money you can make. I could make well, that happens a lot. I mean, not the money so much, but the status I have to make a lot of decisions that affect my status and especially, because I'm are an honest person. People don't always want to hear the truth. So usually it doesn't affect my much money, I make, but it does affect my so-called status because I don't really have super high status as it is. So I don't really have that much to fall there. So you know, it's like one little thing and you are on another lower level, you know, or you could go up a level or down two levels are up to but not usually more than that. So, a situation. Really, it's just like basic. The need to tell somebody like, you're not doing things right. And you tell them that and they get mad and upset and so they, you know, because it could be because I'm around a lot of people that maybe don't have the level of emotional maturity that they should have in the place that they're in. So that's part of it. Yeah. So it's like basically situation. We are trying to tell someone, look, this isn't right what you're doing and you have to stop. I've been told by multiple people. You have to stop and you tell them in the nicest way possible and they shoot the messenger and to say there, you get back at you, which could affect status and money sometimes. So, it could be like a landmine out there, and I haven't had a ton of experience in That area, as far as how, you know, because I am not a manager like, you know, so it's like how do you tell people these things? Because if I wear manager, they probably would respond very differently. Even though I said it the exact same way, but because they view themselves in their own head as being high status, And I'm from this low status, then they say, you know, don't like it anyways and they let everyone know.  Work situations, where I joined the new team people. I went I got a space like a place where I put my art and I put my like retail product type things, sort of a side job. And so there's a new seating people. So, how do I usually behave when I enter a new team? Well, usually, I'm polite. I do try to be polite whether they're new or not new. So, but, of course, it's a new situation. So I typically try to be really polite and understand where they're coming from, and how they are. Because, so many people can behave in. So So many different ways, where one thing you say, could be taken as funny or nice, one place, and then it can be taken as mean and offensive somewhere else. So I try to be aware of that. And do of us again about just being polite and nice but real not fake. I don't try to put on some kind of a show but I do try to be my best of hit that way. Try to be my best self but put a good foot forward there so they don't think I'm just a horrible person and why do I think that is a little because I like Like to make other people feel accepted and cared for whether I just met them, are no known for the most of my life. I like people to feel comfortable and happy to be around me, not scared, or worried that I'm going to, you know, be mean, or hateful to them, or judge them where I come from. It's called Roll out of his cultural people. Here are very different in personality and there's a lot of people that are very rough and dangerous so they're kind of always little bit shell-shocked. Even if you're walking into a board room meeting they're going to be sort of shell-shocked and it may behave see you know depending on where you're at or what's going on they could be overly aggressive. Overly aggressive or under aggressive. It's just all kinds of things.  This is Jason's Winsome and annoyed me. How do you usually react in such situations? It usually depends on how much they've annoyed me. If it's a mild annoyance and they didn't really intentionally do it, I'll just move on. I mean, there's annoyances all day long in life, so if it's just smiled, you know, maybe I'm just grouchier. I do my tolerance level, I usually just Just move on and forget about it. If it's something really really bad and they keep doing it. Well either tell him to stop or I'll just remove myself from the situation. Why do I think that is? Why I think it's because I can get over stimulated easy and I'm aware of that. So I try to look at it as is this something that is Annoying me because it's annoying really bad or because I just can't handle it right now. Or is this something that is so annoying? That something needs to be done about it because it's wrong. Like somebody just popping their gum, Over and over. And, you know, that's their thing. Then I move away. If it's something, like they're going to annoy me with their rude, comments on a daily basis and their epic, rude. I might tell them. Because that's me.  Okay. We're getting start and stop so we times because I kept messing this thing up, I don't know what all you've got or how many minutes I'm at now? Basically this is a new question you got bro. Oh wow okay sorry for this this I would call this a glitch on my part medical it's okay think of situations when your worker works because we're not very organized. That is not very typical of me. I like it organized and I do projects and crafts all the time and I'll make a huge mess. Glue and paper and scissors and strings in things, you can't even identify but when that is over, so is the mess. So I keep my workspace organized because otherwise I can't find things I like to have in holders for my pins but papers can get a bit out of control because they don't have the proper Please like to put these things. There's just no, there's too many papers and not enough space. So I just kind of stack them up in little. Like this goes with this and this goes that but they're not in specific files or drawers. They're just stacked on my desk. That can sometimes get a little messy, but I wouldn't wish I had a better system. Then I wouldn't be that way because I don't like Like messes. So and why do I think it's typical me to not be messy and to stay organized for the most part is because otherwise I cannot find what I'm looking for. I get frustrated when I can't find what I'm looking for. So I don't and I don't like things dirty or scattered like some people put trash balls and wrappers, and candy, and red bulls that are half drank and they just leave them. You just leave him there like and go home, like it was nothing. Waiting for their mama to come. Pick him up, clean up after them, but my mom wouldn't clean up after me. Even she could. So that's maybe why.  \n",

Let's definitely something that I've had experience with in the past. Currently, I have a kind of side job I do and I'm always, it's always up to me. Basically, how much money I make and that situation is, I'm in sales position and well. How do I behave in situations while I make sure that I explain beyond what my role is. What I can do to solve the customers problems, what I can do as far as what I have here, how the process works and how I can get them into a situation that works for them. And again, obviously works for me as well so I can get paid. So throughout the process, I'm helpful understanding. I listen to them, I do kind of guide them in a certain direction and that's just because obviously, that's why I need you to get paid. Additionally I guess other situations that could affect my status. Yeah it's just you know for me training education perspective. Well the number of Publications in such that I can get out. It's a little hard to do right now in my current situation but that's how it is because that's the requirements for certain positions. Say if I want to apply to work in a different area they may care. What am I doing? What's my output like? And that's kind of going to be is to then evaluate me.  All right, so think of situations when I join a new team of people, how do I usually behave when I enter a new team? Well, the first thing I want to do is I want to get familiar with. What we need to do is to team. What, what challenges do, we have whatever you're doing, one of our goals and then I kind of want to see, you know, what's the makeup like, what everyone specialty. What are we like what we like to do for fun? How do we evaluate ourselves how we function together? And what things can we do? Do you know together that we might need to improve on? What, what do we do? Well, it works great and that's just because that's just kind of natural to me. So I want to just, you know, get to know people I'm around. And of course, I'm also focused on problem solving and I just want to make sure I understand where we are, and where we can go. That's just how I look at work.  Hi is the thinking of the time when someone annoyed me, I usually react in situations. And why do I think that is? Well, I tend to be someone who is not usually annoyed. You know, I may have been in the past but I've taken on a more relaxed personality and I just try not to let stuff bother me so much. So I guess there are still some situations, you'll maybe it's something as basically someone just kind of Behaving on professionally a situation. Maybe not having a time management skills and they just had to show up whenever they want to and maybe leave whenever they want to. So they don't finish serving. The customers are working with. See, I have feel frustrated because I feel like Nord. I feel like there's there's why am I here? Why am I doing what I'm doing? And again, that's just because I feel like I should be respected and valued in the situation, I feel like there should be some sort of universal respect. We all have for each other. Because we're all professionals.  All right, so think of a situation where my work or work. Space wasn't very organized. You know? This is not something that's very typical of me. I usually tend to be fairly organized in my workspace - well, I could think of as my digital workspace. So my desktop, it is fairly scattered. In some areas. I have multiple monitors so I attend that has to file from the desktop that I use. Some of them are in folders, which make logical sense. But sometimes I have icons that I have to have four different various functions. I do Do and then maybe I have some various channels that end up there may be some stuff from work out temporarily and instead of you know, allocate to certain areas I just kind of leave it where it is. Yeah. It's just you know because maybe I'm just busy with something and I maybe just don't think about organizing that really too much of a digital organizer. But certainly, I have a clean desk.  \n",

So basically, it was still, I was still learning but also learning a new skill. So I tended to be a little Scattered at those points. And typically, I would succeed and just work through it and generally I am really good at what I do. But those situations can make it very difficult and I think that is because the anxiety associated with it.  Situations, where I joined a new team of people. Usually just observe and try to see. Who actually knows what they're talking about. Who doesn't, who's pretending who's not was good at what they do, things like that. Just trying to learn personalities and things of that nature of those new team members think that is because usually guarded and want to make sure we personally know who could be trusted who not. And I think that is due to years of experience.  I situations in the workplace that have annoyed me in the past would be people that are bragging about skills that they don't really have. They'll go out there and say they're the best this and that but when they're actually, Doing the job function. They don't really have those skills. There's a lot of people like that in sales and I think that is they're trying to overcompensate from their failings or make people believe they're good. So they're not observed on the job. So typically, I I'm annoyed by those type of people.  Situations for my work or my workspace is not very organized. Would be when there's a deadline student to meet, paperwork could be on the desk and then the work might not be organized, because I'm scrambling to get everything done at that last minute, especially if a new task was put upon me. Think that is because I'm focusing on getting it done, not what my surroundings are. So that definitely typically I can. Tend to be disorganized in that manner.  \n",

I've had to make professional decisions that definitely could or have affected my status and potential earning income. I've made specifically career decisions in terms of what areas of the business do I want to focus in and that has certainly impacted the amount of money that I could. Make. And then even within my job on a day-to-day basis, I've had to make decisions. With regard to whether we move forward with new products, whether we move new products into the next phase of their life cycle development. And every one of those decisions could definitely impact my status if the decision turns out bad, or if the products not ready, or if some of my stakeholders, don't agree, then that definitely impacts my status. Definitely does. Not make me look good necessarily with those individuals and then obviously it has a domino effect on my career. So I potentially might not be considered for an annual bonus. I might find my performance rating goes down and as a result, I would also get less compensation. So probably on a monthly basis. I get involved in professional. Decisions that could potentially have the effect on either my status or how much money I make as part of my career.  When I enter a new team, I definitely take an approach of wanting to observe and process as much of the current Team Dynamics, and the personalities of the individuals involved on the team. Although, at the same time, I definitely don't want to be perceived as as being quiet or shy and in that regard as well. So in those new team environment side, Definitely try to really try and understand what's my role over the next couple months while I'm a new member of the team and where do I fit in? What's my, where am I kind of in the hierarchy of the other members on the team and where can I best contribute? But at the same point, not antagonize or or get off on the wrong foot with the other members of my team. And I also try to ask a lot of questions, just in general, I'm very inquisitive, I think, the way I learn is by asking questions in a sort of back-and-forth manner with other individuals. And so, when I enter the new team, I like to find those opportunities to ask questions to have back and forth, dialogue, maybe not within the context of the larger team. Because I know not everybody likes to Listen in and that type of environment. But I will definitely find Opportunities where maybe I can pull somebody to the side, maybe go out and have lunch with somebody and be able to ask a lot more detailed questions to better, understand the project and to understand the team and just to make myself more experienced. Because eventually as other people leave the team, I will find myself in a position where I will, then be one of the more audience members of the team and I want to be prepared at that point.  I've had a number of situations at work where individuals have annoyed me. It's usually individuals that are intentionally trying to get involved in responsibilities that are outside their scope. A lot of times I'll describe it is staying within one's Lane as if you're like a you're you're swimming and Competition and you are expected to stay within your lane and I'll find sometimes, you know, people violate that, they'll step into areas that are definitely well outside their scope. And and as, and as a result that will will tend to be annoying, because we're already busy enough as it is at work, we have a lot of responsibilities on the plate. We have to keep things moving forward. And just like any member of the team, we want to make sure everybody's playing the right position and just like with the sports team, if somebody is playing out of position, you know, as an example, if the if the the quarterback is playing on the offensive line, then you're having to impacts on the team. One is the quarterback isn't necessarily utilizing their skill and likewise the the quarterback is probably not being very effective on the offensive line so I like to get in in situations where everybody's playing the right roles and that's I think the best way to avoid creating an annoyance within the team  I think maybe the situation that I can think of where my work or workspace is not very, organized is usually the first day that I start working on my annual income tax return. I tend to find that my a lot of items have piled up on my desk and I find that even before I can really begin on trying to work the income tax return itself. If I find that one of the things I have to do is just take several hours and organize myself kind of go through, get things organized. Make sure that all the all the paper gets filed into its proper folder. Make sure that all the items that I don't need are thrown away or recycled and I think by going through that process I tend to kind of get very organized at that point. I sort of know where everything is and And then at that point I can begin getting very focused on the activity at hand. So I mean I would say that that situation with income tax is probably similar whenever I have any sort of a big project of having to go through numbers or go through multiple documents and trying to organize and put things together. And I would say that my typical response is to just kind of take Take those first couple hours, get myself organized, disposed of all the, the non necessary items and then that tends to get my mind very focused and ready on the task at hand.  \n",

But no one ever took took the initiative to to use those monies for, for those for those certifications. And really Expanded. My, my career is being able to make advancement make advancement relatively quickly.  What is situations that I can think of, when I joined a new team, the very first thing that I did was really introduced myself to everyone. Look them in the eye shake, shake their hands and tell them that I was really glad to be with them. I did this. Because I wanted to be able to let them know that that I was excited to be with them and I wanted to get to know them.  In situations where someone is annoying me. I do tend to be someone who will ignore them. Who will just let it let it pass over. If it is nothing that is and that is really offensive like racial sexual. Nativist racial sexual nature. I'll allow let that let them know by my demeanor. That I do not approve that I really don't want to listen. If the if the person continues I will I have I have the tendency to go ahead and let them know. Hey I don't really want to talk about this. And I did the reason why I do this is because I want to give people the benefit of a doubt and I want to. But at the same time I want to let them know what my values are.  There have been times that I can remember that I did have and the support kind of a messy work space such as my, my desk. One of the reasons were probably, I was multitasking and I have had, I have had multiple things on my on my desk. It one long time and this is this is just something that I have done with with multitasking. And I think it's because I tried I have Tried to get everything to get everything done all at once.  \n",

have encountered situations when I needed to make professional decisions and those decisions could have affected my status or could have affected the amount of money that I made. When I'm in those situations. I usually behave in a calm manner. I am goal-oriented during those Interactions or situations. And I tend to achieve the goal that I seek with regard to my status, or with regard to the money that I make.  I try to be a team player when I join a new team of people, I try to understand how these individuals work both individually. And as a team, I tried to understand what the team's goal is. And I try not to be a person who controls the team or the situation, but rather learns and contributes with regard to the team of people that I'm interacting with.  when I've been in situations, where someone has annoyed me, I I try to see the situation from their perspective and understand where they're coming from and to see if that we can find a middle ground and also I try to stay calm take deep breaths. If necessary I try to take a break from the situation because Cuz then I can become more calm and I can deal with the situation in a much more effective manner.  My work or work space is typically fairly organized because I tend to work more efficiently and more effectively in a somewhat organized workspace or work environment. The few times, where things are not organized. Is, if I am pressed to meet a deadline, And I usually organize things once the deadline is met but generally speaking I tend to like an organized space and I find that I work better in an organized space. I think there are less distractions.  \n",

So I can definitely think of a situation where the decision I make can pretty much affect my status and how much money I make. So, one scenario is, I'm working on a project and the decisions that I make for that project can affect a company worldwide. So, the decision I made was a great decision. It's a the company pretty much a lot of money and save time as well too and and pretty much helped me get a get a pay raise. So easy in this type of situations I always behave excited and happy. I'm excited to take on these tasks reason why I think that that is the case because I'm from someone that is very eager to learn. Eager to take on tasks even if it's something that I'm not familiar with. With. So I tend to be always, you know, excited to take on these tasks. Typically, I love challenges and it's something that I love to take on. So, based with this quality, that I will pretty much affect my steps and how much money I make at the company.  So when I'm training a new team of people, generally, I'm pretty cooked myself, I'm quiet and I'll be kind of shy and just, you know, stand back and just to see the dynamic other team and see how can pretty much react towards that team. So let's say 15 may be more outgoing or you know, ask more questions or and as something that I mean a respond more to And so, what do I think that is, the reason why I think that is, is because I think it's important to understand the team Dynamic, and it's really important to be able to adapt to the team. So, using positions, when you're hard, not only are you hired for the skills, you know, for the skills and most importantly your heart, whether you can fit the team Dynamic and having that team Dynamic makes, you know, mixed everything flow and Worked just like having having a good team makes makes a dream. Like how they say?  So, you see, when there's a situation where someone has has annoyed me, I keep that to myself. I don't express it, I don't because you don't know, you know, where the factors so using situations that keep calm second. Now, I'll pretty much, you know, try to understand what's going on and understand situation, try to see now the best in people and I'll stay calm and sometimes maybe if they're reacting in a way where it's annoying me. It could be that just having a bad day. I so I try to be aware of the situation was going on and not take anything personal. So why do you think that is? I think it's important to have these You know, qualities were reacted reactant, this type of situations because we don't want to explode and we don't know what's everyone situation is. So if we were to explode one day, that could cost you a job that could cause your promotion, I can cost quite a lot of things. So it's not worth to, you know, react in those situations. It's best not to react ticket, personally, whether if it were this big issue and talk to your manager or whether they can share it, you know, someone that's not real. With a friend or maybe you can laugh about it. And that's, you know, where the best ways to go about it.  It's question is single situation when your work work space for not very organized. How typical is out of you and what do you think that is? So going to accompany, you know, especially a start-up can expect, you know, things to be well, organized or well-established, because the company will be pretty much, you know, starting off. Or even sometimes when you go to another company has made me well established. They won't be a pretty much well organized as far as my experience in the past. I I have seen where it has not been in either. One of us are organized or maybe not been established, which I don't see. The issue is. So why do I think that is?

I'd see, I usually behave pretty calmly in those situations. I think that is because I do a great deal of research and comparison when a situation like that is going to be presented to me. Or I can see it's coming up on the horizon and in taking that Time to prepare for that decision, that may affect status or income. I really weigh the pros and cons and the upside the downside, I think a lot of people don't stop to think about what the upside and downside is to their current situation. And what the upside and downside is to their future situation, especially if it's affecting status or money. And if you actually take the time, not to just look at pros and cons but actually upside for advancement downside for Maybe risk or loss. You may see that there's often times where there's very very big upside and very, very little downside, especially when it comes to staying in your current position or not making that as personal decision. And when you think of things that way it's pretty easy to stay calm because, you know, that your current position. It's no big deal. If you don't make this decision and then if you do make this decision, the downside could be really low in the upside, could be really high, and that's pretty. T reinforcing pretty confidence-inspiring.  So this question should be simple for me. I just joined a new team of people a few months ago so when I enter a new team I usually behave a little more polite open kind and considerate definitely take on more of a listening role rather than a sharing or an outward role and I think that is because I'm trying to get a feel for how things actually work. It's important. It to understand teams of people how they communicate, how they work before you craft your response, or your idea and deliver it to them. You know, you can say something in a certain way and it comes off as positive. You can say that exact same thing in a different way and it comes off as - it really depends on who your audience is. So when I enter a new team, I really need to get a feel for that. How they listen? How They are so that when I share my idea or whatever it may be, it is it shared in the correct way? A way that's receptive to them, and actually gets the idea across same idea, no matter how you say it, but it may be heard different way depending on the team. So, it's really important to listen and understand that team before you start sharing and kind of having more outward roll.  So, I think of situation when somebody is annoyed me know, in the not so distant past, I would get frustrated and angry and think that they were, you know, attacking me in some way. But recently, I've changed my mind set on that. I've really come to understand that all humans have needs that are trying to be met and they have certain feelings that they feel when needs are met or feelings, that they feel would needs are not met. And when you think about all humans, like that is just as pursuit of fulfilling their needs. You have a lot more empathy for people and you also realize that they're not attacking you or they're not trying to do anything to bring you down. They're simply trying to meet their own needs. So now, when someone annoys me so to speak, I react with understanding and compassion and a thought of what needs met. Be trying to meet in that situation. And how might they be feeling and what needs of mine are now not being met in this situation? And how might I be feeling because of this and that self empathy and then empathy for the other person allows us to then, take a step back, and come to come to a solution that actually fulfills. The needs of both of us rather than thinking this person's annoying me. They're annoying there. You know there? They're not doing any good for me. It's all me me, me, me me. When you have that self empathy for your for yourself, which is okay, and then having that empathy for them, you just see annoyances in a completely new light and realize that they're not annoyances. They're simply someone just trying to meet their needs.  So when I think of a situation where my work or work space was not organized. I'd say, that's not very typical of me. Especially my physical workspace. It's generally pretty organized at times my work itself, because I work in a digital space can be a little disorganized, and I think that is because when I'm working on something that I don't really have a lot of passion or care, for, it's hard for me. To really care enough to actually do the work. And then also make sure it's totally organized and buttoned-up, if I don't have a whole lot of passion for it, I understand that I can do the work and whether it's organized or not, doesn't matter if it still gets done. But when you actually have work that you care about, not only do you want to do it in complete it, but you want to maybe reference in the future, maybe share with others and show it off. And if it's organized, that makes it Even easier to do those things. So that's why I think I may have times when I've organized work and not organized work.  \n",

So in situations that could affect my status or how much money I make typically like, if I'm asking for a promotion or a raise at a company, I work for, I will go in calm and confident. I think that's the most important lay out my worth to the company, lay out what I'm providing to them and think of any Points of Leverage I have and then use that to persuade them into giving me more compensation. And I think the reason I do that is because I think it gives me the best chance of making more money or increasing my status. So, yeah, that's that's how I act during situations that can affect my status, or determine how much money that I make.  So when I join a new team and I'm encountering all these new people for the first time. I'm usually kind of a little bears Earth but very friendly and open and I want to kind of gauge how these people act what they're expecting from me. So basically I'm dipping my toes in the pool, trying to feel out how I should act And and I think I do that because I obviously want to fit in when you're a newcomer in a newcomer to a team, you obviously want, you don't want to be alienated or have them view, you weird or different, especially initially because first impressions are very important. So yeah, I think that's why I do that. I kind of just want to fit in and engage the This scenario, before I start acting in a certain way.  In situations where someone annoys me? There's a couple of factors that determine how I react a is, is this intentional or they being annoying on purpose. Another factor is the degree to, which they annoyed me, that also plays a part in it. Another factor is, where am I when this happens? Because if I'm in a professional setting, I probably would act. one way, but if I'm in a personal setting, Excuse me, I would probably act in a different way so it totally depends on a multitude of factors. But typically, In general, I would say I'm level-headed and I'm not quick to react to people, annoying me. I can brush it off or realize it's not intentional and get past it. So I'm generally able to keep a level head and not allow external factors to impact me, but at the same time, if if it's to a degree where it warrants a reaction, then I will have a reaction.  When thinking about situations, where my work or work space is not very organized, I would say, that's not very typical of myself because I like to keep my work organized and efficient because I feel like that allows me to complete work faster. Stay on top of things, things are less, likely to slip my mind. And yeah, I think it's it's very typical. You loved me when I was younger. I think I had issues with organizing my work and over time I've developed systems and put things in place that allow me to stay on top of things and that's definitely helped me in my schooling and also in my professional life at work. So yeah, I do think it's beneficial to work ethic and productivity to keep your work organized.  \n",
