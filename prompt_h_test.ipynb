Of time in my life is a commuter School the age ranges of people attending the school buried quite widely and I suppose I wouldn't categorize the  Environment as being especially socially conducive so I was quite reserved. I would spend most of my time alone playing video games at home or even if school and in like a library, I would watch movies. You can watch movies in the library free. Would you that often? I felt quite uncomfortable with my own  Popularity I suppose in that in that time.

Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: I've had several situations where I've been in a social setting where I didn't know any of the other people or perhaps. I only knew one person of that person was often seen other people in the area. These are situations in which to a certain extent. I do feel like I have a strong sense of self and I'm able to carry on in that scenario and feel pretty good. Part of the reason that I think I sometimes feel uncomfortable in those situations, says, just typically, I'm in person who really values my impact on others and wants to make sure that other people are comfortable. And so, when I have minimal information about the people around me, it can be a bit harder to make decisions on how to best accommodate or connect with other people. I am interested in connecting with others and so it is something that I push myself to do in those situations. Typically feel I'm pretty competent, but I do experience internally more doubts when I just have last information about the people who are around me. I found that just walking up to people and connecting with them tend to be pretty easy. Once I am able to get over that sort of pump with it.\\nQuestion 2: Remember a time when you finished using equipment at work and you could put everything back in place (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation?  \\nAnswer: I tend to be someone who is very oriented to detail and organization. And so when I use a piece of equipment or things like that at work, I tend to be someone who always puts them the way that they were and sometimes even when I noticed that things are out of place or that there's not enough of something, something's not stocked up. I will take it upon myself to sort that out either finding the resources or getting in touch with whoever is in charge of refilling those resources. Generally, I find that it's important to me, that things are in the correct place and working correctly. I know that this really eases the burden on other people at the clinic who might be looking for materials. And I feel compassionate for those people, particularly because I've experienced. I know others have experienced times when things aren't where they're supposed to be and that causes hardship and confusion, and makes it more difficult to be on time and show up in a way that's present and clear with clients and that is really important to me.\\nQuestion 3: Remember a time when you took part in a group discussion and you could assume a listening or leading role. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Personally, in group discussions. I find myself vacillating between listening and leading roles being a good listener. Something that I really pride myself on and is very important to the work that I currently do. And so being able to hear others opinions is helpful for me because it allows me to understand people better. If it allows me to access compassion for them and understanding of their perspective to get a sense of other people's opinions. All of those are very important to me. And there are times when I enjoy a leading role as well. This is particularly when I feel I do have some expertise on the topic or that it's something that others are not taking the lead on and it feels important to keep the conversation going or push it to important topics that have not yet been addressed in that conversation. And so it's important to me really balance those things. I don't typically take Eating rolls. If I feel that that leading role will lead to me, sort of usurping the conversation, directing it for my own interest or anything like that. I find is important to really balance bleeding things and pushing and conversation forward to important areas. While, also being able to step back and really listen to the people who are also taking part in that discussion. I think in a workplace, it's really important that all people are valued. And when I access my empathy, I think about what I've been part of a group discussions, led by other people and just feeling remembering feeling that it was nice to be included. And making sure that everyone's perspective is hard.\\nQuestion 4: Remember a time when a task was more challenging than usual and that you could decide to push yourself harder or leave it aside (or pass it to someone else). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: When a task is more challenging than usual, I tends to be someone who pushes forward with it. I used to be someone who would push forward with things just because it was important to me to complete the task and also important work independently, however, and more recent years. I've really learned the importance of pushing harder with a task while. Also being able to ask for help. I am someone who enjoys collaboration and work collectively with other people and I've also learned that it's better to do a task with help, then to spend a lot of time. Attempting a task that I'm not able to figure out on my own. It's remains important to me to still do the job. If it was assigned to me and be the primary and a weed on the task. But I also think it's it's a unique skill to be able to ask for help. I think that it shows humility and respect to other people who may have more expertise in a certain area.\\nQuestion 5: Remember a time when you were invited to an after-work social event and you could decide to join or skip it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Typically if I feel that an after-work social event will be appropriate and ensured that, no work-related boundaries are crossed, particularly regarding its supervisory positions are other positions with power dynamic. As long as I feel like those will remain intact and the social event is socially appropriate in that, I typically will decide to join it. I do really enjoy connecting with co-workers, particularly at organizations. I really value because I feel like we share a set of values and interests that make it really important and exciting to connect with other people on. And I consider myself to be someone who is social and really value that connection. I think that I can improve the culture in the workplace itself to have deeper connections with the people outside work.\\nQuestion 6: Remember a time when a task required paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: At work. I am getting many tasks that require extreme attention to detail in order to complete a task accurately and not make mistakes. I find that this is how you do really? Well with someone who is very detail-oriented, and able to focus, my attention for these details and remain accurate. A skill of mine. I think is paying attention to details while also being able to see the bigger picture of a task, but the details in particular, allow me to really focus on someone who is meticulous and really enjoy tossed. That allowed me to focus in on details. in order to avoid making mistakes, I  typically will review the materials out of time to ensure that before I engage in the task. I know what is going to entail. So I know what kind of details to focus on and  Can complete the task with the highest level of accuracy possible?\\nQuestion 7: Remember a time when your team members were feeling down and you could decide to raise their spirit (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: I tend to be someone who is really compassionate and soft-hearted. And so when I see that someone that I'm working with is feeling down or struggling, with some want, something that's really important to me, to be able to come and talk to them about it and hopefully help them out. Sometimes emotionally, sometimes in a practical sense and sometimes both. And so I think that this contributes to a helpful work culture where everyone can feel supportive. I consider myself and pathetic and supportive and so raising other people's Spirits feels really important to me both because out them and because it improves the general work environment and also by the sense that A general sense among all co-workers that will be supported regardless of what we're going through and I really value organizations and people within organizations who care about others feelings and personal experiences.\\nQuestion 8: Remember a time when you wanted something badly at work and you could act on an impulse (or not) in order to get it.

I'm someone who is, as I mentioned, very meticulous, and also really hard working. And so, if it's something that I'm able to build up to, that's really important to me to feel like I make sure that the opportunity is a good fit and to ensure that I know everything about it to make sure that it it seems like it actually would be a good fit for me and that I would be a good fit for the opportunity itself. I'm so in terms of acting impulsively, that's not something that I tend to do. I think that being level-headed and thoughtful about decisions is very important.

We will contact you within a week about the outcome of the selection procedure.\\n Please assess the job-related competencies for the interviewee based on the answers in their interview, using the following rating system: 'high' for scores between 5 and 3.5, 'neutral' for scores between 3.5 and 2.5, and 'low' for scores between 2.5 and 1.0. Assign ratings to the following competencies: Communication flexibility (i.e., the ability to convey a message in different ways, depending on perceptions and responses); Persuasiveness (i.e., gaining acceptance of, or agreement with, a standpoint from others through a well-considered use of arguments, personal authority and/or diplomacy); Quality orientation (i.e., making an effort to deliver high-quality work, focusing on achieving or exceeding the established quality standards in one's own work and performance or that of others); and Development orientation (i.e., exerting oneself in order to broaden and deepen knowledge and skills and to gain new experiences in order to grow professionally and increase the quality of one’s own work).

Additionally, please also rated ‘overall hireability’, defined as the extent to which the candidate would be able to fulfill the requirements of the management traineeship position. \\nQuestion 1: Remember a time when you were in a social setting where you didn't know any of the other people, and this affected the extent to which you felt (un)comfortable with yourself. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: I'm someone who really enjoys trying new things and there was a time when I was in a room where I knew no one I had decided to attend a networking event with alumni from my grad school and I walked into a room full of Highly qualified and very gifted professional in my field and I didn't know a single person there. So I decided to meet that head-on and I made a note to be even more friendly than I otherwise would tend to seek out people. I wouldn't normally just approached as the blue and I didn't make him some great connections.\\nQuestion 2: Remember a time when you finished using equipment at work and you could put everything back in place (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation?  \\nAnswer: Generally, I am a very tidy person. I believe that everything has a place and should be returned to that place when you're done using it. I worked as a class assistant this past semester for trial advocacy performance section. And in that role, I was responsible for removing all of the crops that would be needed for that night's performances and then returning them after the fact so I kept a very careful record of what I removed and what I needed to return and made sure that I only took what was necessary for each trip. I also kept track of the passwords to get into and out of that Supply Closet and it was a nice exercise in practicing my security when it came to the assets of my organization.\\nQuestion 3: Remember a time when you took part in a group discussion and you could assume a listening or leading role. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Generally, I am someone who is very aware of my surroundings and the people who are around me and I try to make sure that I am either contributing or actively learning that I am listening to everyone around me as much as possible as law students by cohort and I very much enjoy the only political discussions but discussions of issues race sex and gender and so when I found myself in such a discussion with my fellow students I listened when there was something to learn and I spoke at 1 there was something to contribute from my perspective a big believer that if you don't know what you're talkin about, you should listen to someone who does and so I tried to practice that in that moment.\\nQuestion 4: Remember a time when a task was more challenging than usual and that you could decide to push yourself harder or leave it aside (or pass it to someone else). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Generally, I am a fairly stubborn and motivated person. I went challenge by a task. I tend to not give up on it. I kind of take it as a challenge and try to rise and get it even if it gets more and more difficult. I was tasked with completing a forensic audit of my previous employers foreign rights finances and despite not having any accounting experience and being confronted with a dearth of information I persevered\\nQuestion 5: Remember a time when you were invited to an after-work social event and you could decide to join or skip it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Generally, I am pretty outgoing and social and I also very much believe in fostering connections with the people you work with. I think that makes you a better team as well as a better member of that team. So when my boss invited a group of us to watch her perform stand-up comedy a few Towns over I was very enthusiastic and all about that. I immediately accepted and started arranging for transportation for my co-workers and I to go see her\\nQuestion 6: Remember a time when a task required paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: In my previous role attention to detail was a huge aspects of my job and extremely important especially when we would be hit with what are what we called scheduling blitzes and during those periods. I would need to schedule up to 40 or 50 meetings across three to five days and attention to detail was everything as was organization in that case because if you slipped up or forgot to get back to someone they felt slighted and there could be long-lasting impact to the business. So I prepared I came up with organizational structures and I kept meticulous notes as I was going in order to ensure that no detail was overlooked or not addressed during that.\\nQuestion 7: Remember a time when your team members were feeling down and you could decide to raise their spirit (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Generally, I am a very supportive team member and I go out of my way to try and support my team members and give them what they need from me in order to so when our office manager was feeling down because of circumstances in her life. I ask myself what I could do to make her day a little brighter and easier giving her a few small gifts as well as making arrangements for her least favorite task to be completed without her involvement necessary and that made that j a little bit better for her.\\nQuestion 8: Remember a time when you wanted something badly at work and you could act on an impulse (or not) in order to get it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: In my previous role, we had a variety of jobs and tasks available at pretty much all times. It was a small company. And so if something had to get done a number of Arsenal team would have to do it and these tasks could be just about anyting a project came out that I was very passionate about and I decided to throw my name in the ring, but I wanted to be deliberate about it and make the best showing possible. But I initially acted on impulse by stating my interest in taking on the project by then... Not with impulse by making a full presentation about why I was the best person for that particular project. I ended up being sign their project and it went very well.\\nPlease answer with the template:\\nCommunication flexibility: rating \\nPersuasiveness: rating \\nQuality orientation: rating \\nDevelopment orientation: rating \\nOverall hireability: rating \\nand why.

I was one of those personal friends, but some of them also knew people that worked with him. So since everyone already was in the entertainment industry, they all talked to each other and I wasn't in the entertainment industry and I didn't really know what to say.

But sometimes there are certain things only need for certain things like a blender or a torch if we're going to torch something for a specific drink a wheels of a brander specifically for coconut and Weaver, and it all  like all the coconuts and it has a logo for the restaurant. We fill the Coconuts with different Liquors and stuff and I am very meticulous. So I have everything organized I get all the Coconuts out and then I take out the brander get that heated while I'm taking out the Coconuts already. I would brand everything and then have it cool cuz it's a very very hot Brandy and then I would put all the Coconuts away. And then while the brander was cool, but then I would be cold then I would go ahead and put the brand or away. So I would get everything done probably very fast in the way that would be cleaning up right after myself. I would clean as I go in that situation any time that I have to use equipment or different specialty equipment at work or in my regular life.

So any weekend day or for us also Tuesdays because we do Taco Tuesday 7 Mexican restaurant. It's very very busy and sometimes it's just chaos and you don't have time to game plan beforehand because it has just happened. So sometimes I jump in and assume leadership and just start delegating more people need to go whether my managers there are not and he already knows that I do this but he appreciates that I do it because he's already doing something else. And since I keep everything clean, I also make sure that everything else sees in the same. Order and everyone else is doing the same thing keeping in their same order if they use something and they don't put it away than I tell them that they should put it away and make sure that they're keeping up with my standards as well if they're going to work around me.\\nQuestion 4: Remember a time when a task was more challenging than usual and that you could decide to push yourself harder or leave it aside (or pass it to someone else).

Then I take everything on and make sure that doesn't go down and keep everything afloat one time after the holidays. It was very very busy New Years was incredibly busy and I had some personal things going on, but you can't not work during the holidays, so I went to work and Then I started breaking down because it became too busy and too much to handle. So I went and talked to my manager and communicated what was happening and I said that I needed to switch out with someone so that I can go do something else that would be productive while they were taking on this and it was very difficult for me to do that because I like to take everything on and I don't like to look like or feel like a failure but I have learned that I can't always take everything on it. I do need to communicate if I want the ship to not go down.\\nQuestion 5: Remember a time when you were invited to an after-work social event and you could decide to join or skip it.

Could you describe your personality. Situation? Yes this happens.  Any time that I would be invited I declined it because I do not mix my personal life with my work life. And that is just how I have always been so in turn I actually don't get invited to many things, which is fine with me sometime. I have made friends at work and hang out with people. That's fine. But just because of  Maybe 10 years experience of work and then trying to make friends with everyone that I work with and learning that not everyone is worth it. So I don't push myself to have to make friends at work. Sometimes it just naturally happens. But most of the time I will just declined something else is something that I want to do and then I will invite someone to it but just who I am. I usually like to keep my personal life in my professional life separate, especially because I work in a bar.\\nQuestion 6: Remember a time when a task required paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes.

If someone were to ingest dry ice or if someone were to not know how to handle it which makes someone been ingested because they don't know they're ingesting it so I am a very picky  very started at work. If I see someone not handling it properly properly. I will be very verbal about it just because I am very afraid and anxious of harming someone myself and making a mistake so I don't want anyone else to do.\\nQuestion 7: Remember a time when your team members were feeling down and you could decide to raise their spirit (or not).

Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: I've had several situations where I've been in a social setting where I didn't know any of the other people or perhaps. I only knew one person of that person was often seen other people in the area. These are situations in which to a certain extent. I do feel like I have a strong sense of self and I'm able to carry on in that scenario and feel pretty good. Part of the reason that I think I sometimes feel uncomfortable in those situations, says, just typically, I'm in person who really values my impact on others and wants to make sure that other people are comfortable. And so, when I have minimal information about the people around me, it can be a bit harder to make decisions on how to best accommodate or connect with other people. I am interested in connecting with others and so it is something that I push myself to do in those situations. Typically feel I'm pretty competent, but I do experience internally more doubts when I just have last information about the people who are around me. I found that just walking up to people and connecting with them tend to be pretty easy. Once I am able to get over that sort of pump with it.\\nQuestion 2: Remember a time when you finished using equipment at work and you could put everything back in place (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation?  \\nAnswer: I tend to be someone who is very oriented to detail and organization. And so when I use a piece of equipment or things like that at work, I tend to be someone who always puts them the way that they were and sometimes even when I noticed that things are out of place or that there's not enough of something, something's not stocked up. I will take it upon myself to sort that out either finding the resources or getting in touch with whoever is in charge of refilling those resources. Generally, I find that it's important to me, that things are in the correct place and working correctly. I know that this really eases the burden on other people at the clinic who might be looking for materials. And I feel compassionate for those people, particularly because I've experienced. I know others have experienced times when things aren't where they're supposed to be and that causes hardship and confusion, and makes it more difficult to be on time and show up in a way that's present and clear with clients and that is really important to me.\\nQuestion 3: Remember a time when you took part in a group discussion and you could assume a listening or leading role. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Personally, in group discussions. I find myself vacillating between listening and leading roles being a good listener. Something that I really pride myself on and is very important to the work that I currently do. And so being able to hear others opinions is helpful for me because it allows me to understand people better. If it allows me to access compassion for them and understanding of their perspective to get a sense of other people's opinions. All of those are very important to me. And there are times when I enjoy a leading role as well. This is particularly when I feel I do have some expertise on the topic or that it's something that others are not taking the lead on and it feels important to keep the conversation going or push it to important topics that have not yet been addressed in that conversation. And so it's important to me really balance those things. I don't typically take Eating rolls. If I feel that that leading role will lead to me, sort of usurping the conversation, directing it for my own interest or anything like that. I find is important to really balance bleeding things and pushing and conversation forward to important areas. While, also being able to step back and really listen to the people who are also taking part in that discussion. I think in a workplace, it's really important that all people are valued. And when I access my empathy, I think about what I've been part of a group discussions, led by other people and just feeling remembering feeling that it was nice to be included. And making sure that everyone's perspective is hard.\\nQuestion 4: Remember a time when a task was more challenging than usual and that you could decide to push yourself harder or leave it aside (or pass it to someone else). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: When a task is more challenging than usual, I tends to be someone who pushes forward with it. I used to be someone who would push forward with things just because it was important to me to complete the task and also important work independently, however, and more recent years. I've really learned the importance of pushing harder with a task while. Also being able to ask for help. I am someone who enjoys collaboration and work collectively with other people and I've also learned that it's better to do a task with help, then to spend a lot of time. Attempting a task that I'm not able to figure out on my own. It's remains important to me to still do the job. If it was assigned to me and be the primary and a weed on the task. But I also think it's it's a unique skill to be able to ask for help. I think that it shows humility and respect to other people who may have more expertise in a certain area.\\nQuestion 5: Remember a time when you were invited to an after-work social event and you could decide to join or skip it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Typically if I feel that an after-work social event will be appropriate and ensured that, no work-related boundaries are crossed, particularly regarding its supervisory positions are other positions with power dynamic. As long as I feel like those will remain intact and the social event is socially appropriate in that, I typically will decide to join it. I do really enjoy connecting with co-workers, particularly at organizations. I really value because I feel like we share a set of values and interests that make it really important and exciting to connect with other people on. And I consider myself to be someone who is social and really value that connection. I think that I can improve the culture in the workplace itself to have deeper connections with the people outside work.\\nQuestion 6: Remember a time when a task required paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: At work. I am getting many tasks that require extreme attention to detail in order to complete a task accurately and not make mistakes. I find that this is how you do really? Well with someone who is very detail-oriented, and able to focus, my attention for these details and remain accurate. A skill of mine. I think is paying attention to details while also being able to see the bigger picture of a task, but the details in particular, allow me to really focus on someone who is meticulous and really enjoy tossed. That allowed me to focus in on details. in order to avoid making mistakes, I  typically will review the materials out of time to ensure that before I engage in the task. I know what is going to entail. So I know what kind of details to focus on and  Can complete the task with the highest level of accuracy possible?\\nQuestion 7: Remember a time when your team members were feeling down and you could decide to raise their spirit (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: I tend to be someone who is really compassionate and soft-hearted. And so when I see that someone that I'm working with is feeling down or struggling, with some want, something that's really important to me, to be able to come and talk to them about it and hopefully help them out. Sometimes emotionally, sometimes in a practical sense and sometimes both. And so I think that this contributes to a helpful work culture where everyone can feel supportive. I consider myself and pathetic and supportive and so raising other people's Spirits feels really important to me both because out them and because it improves the general work environment and also by the sense that A general sense among all co-workers that will be supported regardless of what we're going through and I really value organizations and people within organizations who care about others feelings and personal experiences.\\nQuestion 8: Remember a time when you wanted something badly at work and you could act on an impulse (or not) in order to get it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: If I really bout you an opportunity at work and see an opportunity to get it, my behavior sort of depends on the situation. I'm someone who is, as I mentioned, very meticulous, and also really hard working. And so, if it's something that I'm able to build up to, that's really important to me to feel like I make sure that the opportunity is a good fit and to ensure that I know everything about it to make sure that it it seems like it actually would be a good fit for me and that I would be a good fit for the opportunity itself. I'm so in terms of acting impulsively, that's not something that I tend to do. I think that being level-headed and thoughtful about decisions is very important.

Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Gillette the best example of this would be when I moved away to Florida to go to college. I go to University of Florida and last year. I moved there and moved in the dorms and I didn't know anybody going there from my school or state or anything. I didn't know anybody and I'm in May I live in Maryland. So it's a big, a big move and I was I was pretty scared and anxious about it, going into it and the first couple days I was there. I didn't really meet anyone. So I was like, all this is that I'm not going to meet anyone and it was scary. But then I realize that I just got up, everyone's in that situation. So I started just saying hi to everyone and asking people. If they wanted to do stuff in really quickly. I met a lot of great people. And then looking back at it. I was like, that's  It was unnecessary. We still worried because I am a very social person and I am very good at.  Making new friends and see. I really wasn't anything to worry about and I was in an up being great, and I loved it there. So.\\nQuestion 2: Remember a time when you finished using equipment at work and you could put everything back in place (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation?  \\nAnswer: I know this isn't at work, but I haven't really worked at a job where there's been much use of equipment like big women, right thing. But I did used to play badminton in high school and after practice, we would always have to put the Mets away.  Show. That was always a big process. It's kind of difficult, a lot of components involved and I am not.  I'm not that great at knowing how to do it or anything. But so I can time it was my turn to put all the nuts away and I had to figure it out cuz I didn't really know how to do it my first time and I just stuck with it. I'm I'm pretty good at looking at things and figuring out how they work.  That's what I did. I felt looked it was logical and I've actually figured out except to work on it for a bit. And now I can do it super quickly. So, you know, just practice is always good.\\nQuestion 3: Remember a time when you took part in a group discussion and you could assume a listening or leading role. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: We had a lot of group discussions in English class and often times. I felt that I would be the one that typically took all those discussions.  Most people didn't really care and thought I was Dumb and just didn't really want to participate, but I usually be interested in the material and I would want to get a good grade. So I usually ended up taking charge and reading them and got to stepping up since nobody else wanted to. Typically I do tend to assume leadership positions just because I don't like being told what to do. So I often like that's not that it's I would prefer being the one in charge.  Compared to anything else.  And so I would oftentimes take the lead lead the discussion kind of guy that you know, I'm always good at keeping conversations going. So if I thought that we needed more I would just keep prompting and ask you more questions. So eventually get a really good discussion guy.\\nQuestion 4: Remember a time when a task was more challenging than usual and that you could decide to push yourself harder or leave it aside (or pass it to someone else). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: The situation actually happens to me quite often because I work at a front desk at a hotel.  So a lot of times and often times I'm there by myself, as the only one in those out and I will always have customers coming up to me with situation cuz I am still fairly new. Also. I've only worked there a couple months. So I don't you takes a while to know everything there is to know about procedures and everything at the hotel. So, a lot of times customers or guests will come up in present to me with something and I really am not sure what path to take in resolving that issue.  But I am very thoughtful and intuitive when it comes to those things. I figure out what would probably be the most logical way to respond to this do instead of calling my boss or waiting for the next person to get there and just letting them deal with it. I try to do with it myself to the best of my ability and sometimes it'll be a case where I will have to call my boss, but I won't ever leave it for the next person because I wouldn't want anyone to do that to me and I just don't think that's the right thing to do. So I do will always try my hardest to figure it out, myself and do the right thing. And if not, I will call my boss.  And then we'll resolve it that way.\\nQuestion 5: Remember a time when you were invited to an after-work social event and you could decide to join or skip it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: A lot of time at my old job. We would we were all the same age and often everyone would go out and do something after our shifts. If a lot of them and it at the same time and I would always say I love hanging out with my co-workers. I think it's great to bond with them and it's a good opportunity to make friends some jobs if if it's appropriate and yeah, I would always hang out with them after work and go to do social events with them. I am very eager to make new friends and I am very social. I'd love to do things with people and at. Yeah, like I said, I think it's great when they were co-workers cuz it just gives you another opportunity to bond with them and just more opportunities for friendship. so, if I wasn't initiating the  Going to social event after work, then I would definitely always join if I was able to.\\nQuestion 6: Remember a time when a task required paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: so at my job, at the hotel, there are a lot of tasks that require detail such as making reservations or  Changing reservations the financial aspects. So you do really have to be careful with a lot of things and I I write everything down.  That's how I get through it as I have, my Post-It notes on my desk and I'm very thorough with it. So I do not forget anything.  If I can't put it into the computer at that moment and then I always remember to go back and do it. I am a very detail-oriented person. I like details. Whenever I give someone a task. I always give a lot of details because  I appreciate that when I am given a task just cuz it's good to know exactly what you're doing and exactly how to do your job. So I think it's very beneficial to paid to details details and I always I always do by writing everything down because there's too much to be able to remember it all in my head. I know I would forget some of it. So just writing things down is how I get through that situation.\\nQuestion 7: Remember a time when your team members were feeling down and you could decide to raise their spirit (or not). Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: So this often happens on sports teams when we're losing or with a big game and we're not doing well, and I always try to be, I tend to be very positive. I have a very positive outlook. So even if we are losing, there's always the hey, we can, we can still win. And, and I would always tell people that if they were feeling upset about it, or I guess I thought your day today, but, you know, there's a lot, plenty of other games. And you know, what? The end of the day for fun. So as long as you're just make the most out of it and try your hardest and then that's all you can do. And so that's type it. Typically I I don't like seeing people upset or down. I think especially as somebody is supposed to be fun like sports game or anything. So I always try my hardest and try to be that person that they know that I can come to for support and just just for help or anything and  So yeah, I say that I would I would be a good person for that just raising morale and just keeping staying positive is a huge thing for me. I always try and stay positive and I try to reflect that on the others.\\nQuestion 8: Remember a time when you wanted something badly at work and you could act on an impulse (or not) in order to get it. Could you describe your personality in that situation? \\nAnswer: Neither wasn't a situation where it was an Impulse, but they're obviously were raises that I wanted to get. But for this it's more of a slow process from the beginning. I knew that I would probably eventually want a raise or upgraded position. So, I just from the beginning, you know, it's the process. I would just always work. My hardest show management that I knew what I was doing. I liked what I was doing. I'm a good hard worker. I'm good with being nice to all the gas cuz I work in customer service. Be nice to all of the gas then really just treat them well and do my job correctly. So that  knowing that when the time comes to be considered, they would look at me and think while she's always been good at her job. And and also it's just that's just the right thing to do is always just try your hardest and have a good worth it epic. So I typically always send to do my job to the best of my ability because they benefits everyone. And I think that that's a really good trait to have\\nPlease answer with the template:\\nCommunication flexibility: rating \\nPersuasiveness: rating \\nQuality orientation: rating \\nDevelopment orientation: rating \\nOverall hireability: rating \\nand why.

I did feel that bit aloof from the community up in the crowd on myself that there wasn't really anything to talk about and there wasn't any way to really connect, those out that I was interacting with.  My personality situation, I would say, as I've said already, I was a bit aloof. I was nervous. I was shy and  I guess I could also say that I was a bit upset with myself that I wasn't able to.
